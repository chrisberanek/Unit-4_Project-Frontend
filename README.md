# Unit-4_Project-College Selection List Big Board
## Project #4: Building a Full-Stack Application with React Frontend and Node/Express Backend

# Student Athlete College Search Tool

This application is a DEMO version for the Database Administrator role for a student college selection tool.

High school students that plan to attend college and who also currently participate in one or more sports and would like to continue their altletic career at the next level can use this application to narrow the search parameters down by filtering factors such as:

Geopgraphic Region of the US
Minumum Academic Requirement for a School
Sports Offered by a given School

This application is based on the technology platform of utilizing an "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) with CRUD functionality on a Student database that uses RESTful routes via JavaScript and HTML using React, Express and Node.js frameworks.
